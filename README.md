Welcome to the Zomato Data Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Zomato's data, where we uncover key insights into restaurant performance, customer preferences, and more.




                                                       🚀 Project Overview

In this project, we aim to explore Zomato's dataset using various data science techniques to understand:

Customer dining habits.
Restaurant ratings and reviews.
Location-based restaurant preferences.
Pricing trends across cities and countries.
By the end of this project, we aim to extract meaningful patterns and offer data-driven insights that can help restaurants improve their service and customer targeting strategies.
